Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. 
(A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

NOTES

1. list indexing
- start counting lists from number 0
- use var[] to get the elem of the list
- or use[:] to get a range not including the last elem chosen
    - a[1,2,3,4,5]
    - a[0:3] would give [1,2,3] (easy way to get sublists between two indices)
    - a third number in indexing counts how often you should read from the list
        - [1:5:4] would mean:
            give numbers in list between num1 and num5, starting at num1 and goin up by 4s
